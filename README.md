# House-Price-Prediction
Here's a sample `README.md` file for a **House Price Prediction** project. This version assumes you’ve built a machine learning model (e.g., using Python, Scikit-learn, etc.), but I can tailor it further based on your tools, language, or framework.

# 🏡 House Price Prediction

Predict house prices based on various features such as area, location, number of rooms, and more using machine learning.


## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to predict the prices of houses using supervised machine learning techniques. The model is trained on historical housing data and makes predictions based on features like size, location, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, and other key factors.

## 📊 Dataset

* **Source**: \[Specify dataset source — e.g., Kaggle, UCI, custom]

* **Features**:

  * `Location`
  * `Size (sqft)`
  * `Number of bedrooms`
  * `Number of bathrooms`
  * `Year built`
  * `...`

* **Target**: `Price`



## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

* **Model Used**: Linear Regression / Random Forest / XGBoost (specify what you used)
* **Libraries**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn



## 🔧 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
cd house-price-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

### 1. Train the model

```bash
python src/train.py
```

### 2. Predict house price

```bash
python src/predict.py --area 2000 --bedrooms 3 --bathrooms 2 --location "Downtown"
```

### 3. Run the web app (if available)

```bash
cd app
streamlit run app.py
```



## 📈 Results

* **Training Accuracy**: 92%
* **Test Accuracy**: 89%
* **RMSE**: \$23,000

> *Note: Replace with actual results once you evaluate your model.*



## 🛠️ Future Work

* Improve model accuracy with feature engineering
* Add location intelligence (geospatial data)
* Deploy using Flask/Streamlit and host on Heroku or AWS
* Add unit tests and CI/CD pipeline



## 🙌 Acknowledgments

* Dataset by \[Kaggle/UCI/specific provider]
* Inspired by \[any relevant projects]
